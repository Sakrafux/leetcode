# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

Given the <code>head</code> of a linked list, remove the <code>n^th</code> node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg" style="width: 542px; height: 222px;">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is <code>sz</code>.
- <code>1 <= sz <= 30</code>
- <code>0 <= Node.val <= 100</code>
- <code>1 <= n <= sz</code>

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution

We simply traverse the list and store each pointer in an array. This allows us to know the total size to calculate which node to remove, and to actually access its neighbours in order to remove the target node.
